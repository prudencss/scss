# :eagle: Prudencss - SCSS ITCSS extensible custom design framework

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/prudencss/scss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/prudencss/scss)

Inspired by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/) ITCSS paradigm/CSS architectural pattern.

### Motivation

Being a frontend developer I found myself in the position to implement custom designs and it was rather difficult to use
typical CSS component frameworks, because their design wasn't flexible enough.
Though some do have themeing possibly other design flexibility mechanisms, I couldn't find a nice way to simply grab
some readymade components that would be easy to style.
Also, I wanted to be able to have a nice CSS basis ... like, a decent normalizing/reset, utility classes, reusable mechanisms etc ...

Googling around I found HaitiCSS and some other ITCSS frameworks, forked it ... and adapted it somewhat.
Now there you go.

I'm trying to develop this CSS basis first and then create js/web-components as well.
